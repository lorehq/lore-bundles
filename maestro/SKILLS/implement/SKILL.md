# Implement -- Task Execution Engine

Execute tasks from a track's implementation plan, following the configured workflow methodology (TDD or ship-fast). Supports single-agent mode (default), team mode (`--team`), and parallel mode (`--parallel`).

## Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS`

- `<track-name>`: Match track by name or ID substring. Optional -- auto-selects if only one track is pending.
- `--team`: Enable team mode with parallel workers (kraken/spark).
- `--parallel`: Enable parallel mode with Task sub-agents in isolated worktrees.
- `--resume`: Skip already-completed tasks (marked `[x]`) and continue from next `[ ]` task.

---

## Step 1: Mode Detection

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:
- If contains `--team` --> team mode (see `reference/team-mode.md`)
- If contains `--parallel` --> parallel mode (see `reference/parallel-mode.md`)
- Otherwise --> single-agent mode (default)
- If contains `--resume` --> set resume flag

## Step 2: Track Selection

1. Read `.maestro/tracks.md`. Parse status markers: `[ ]` = new, `[~]` = in-progress, `[x]` = complete. Support both `- [ ] **Track:` and legacy `## [ ] Track:` formats.
2. **If track name given**: Match by exact ID or case-insensitive substring on description. If multiple matches, ask user.
3. **If no track name**: Filter `[ ]`/`[~]` tracks. 0 = error, 1 = auto-select, multiple = ask user.
4. **Confirm selection**: Ask user to start or cancel.

## Step 3: Load Context

Load context in tiers to minimize upfront token cost:

### Essential (load immediately)
1. Read track plan: `.maestro/tracks/{track_id}/plan.md`
2. Read track spec: `.maestro/tracks/{track_id}/spec.md`

### Deferred (load at first task start)
3. Read workflow config: `.maestro/context/workflow.md`
4. Read tech stack: `.maestro/context/tech-stack.md`

### On-demand (load only if relevant to current task)
5. Read guidelines: `.maestro/context/guidelines.md` (if exists)
6. Read code style guides: `.maestro/context/code_styleguides/` (if exists)
7. Note matched skills from `.maestro/tracks/{track_id}/metadata.json` `"skills"` array. Reference their guidance when relevant to current task (skill descriptions are already in runtime context). **Graceful degradation**: if missing/empty, proceed without.
8. Read `.maestro/notepad.md` (if exists). Extract `## Priority Context` bullets. These are injected as constraints into task execution context. **Graceful degradation**: if missing or empty, skip.

## Step 4: Update Track Status

Edit `.maestro/tracks.md`: `[ ]` --> `[~]`. Update `metadata.json`: `"status": "in_progress"`.

## Step 4.5: BR Check

**BR check**: If `metadata.json` has `beads_epic_id`, set `br_enabled=true`. All BR operations below only apply when `br_enabled`. See `reference/br-integration.md` for commands.

If `br_enabled` and `.beads/` does not exist: `br init --prefix maestro --json`.

## Step 5: Build Task Queue

Parse `plan.md`: identify phases (`## Phase N`), tasks (`### Task N.M`), sub-tasks (`- [ ] ...`).
If `--resume`: skip tasks already marked `[x]`.

If `br_enabled`: use `bv -robot-plan -label "track:{epic_id}" -format json` to get dependency-respecting execution order. If `--resume`: use `br list --status open --label "phase:{N}" --json` to identify remaining work. Fall back to plan.md parsing if `bv` is unavailable.

## Single-Agent Mode (Default)

### Step 6a: Execute Tasks Sequentially

Follow the TDD or ship-fast methodology for each task.
See `reference/single-agent-execution.md` for the full Red-Green-Refactor cycle (steps 6a.1-6a.9), ship-fast variant, and skill injection protocol.
See `reference/tdd-workflow.md` for TDD best practices and anti-patterns.

### Step 7a: Phase Completion Verification

When the last task in a phase completes, run the Phase Completion Protocol.
See `reference/phase-completion.md` for details (coverage check, full test run, manual verification, user confirmation).

---

## Parallel Mode (--parallel)

See `reference/parallel-mode.md` for full protocol: plan analysis for task independence, wave-based sub-agent spawning with worktree isolation, result verification and merge, conflict detection, and sequential fallback.

---

## Team Mode (--team)

See `reference/team-mode.md` for full protocol: team creation, task delegation, worker spawning, monitoring, verification, and shutdown.

---

## Step 8: Track Completion

When ALL phases are complete, run the Track Completion Protocol.
See `reference/track-completion.md` for details (mark complete, skill effectiveness recording, cleanup, final commit, summary).

## Relationship to Other Commands

Recommended workflow:

- `/setup` -- Scaffold project context (run first)
- `/new-track` -- Create a feature/bug track with spec and plan
- `/implement` -- **You are here.** Execute the implementation
- `/review` -- Verify implementation correctness
- `/status` -- Check progress across all tracks
- `/revert` -- Undo implementation if needed
- `/note` -- Capture decisions and context to persistent notepad

Implementation consumes the `plan.md` created by `/new-track`. Each task produces atomic commits, which `/review` can analyze to verify correctness against the spec. Run `/status` to check progress mid-implementation, or `/revert` to undo if something goes wrong.
