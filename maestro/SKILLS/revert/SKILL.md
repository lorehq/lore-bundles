# Revert -- Git-Aware Undo

Safely revert implementation work at track, phase, or task granularity. Updates plan state to reflect the rollback.

## Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS`

- `<track>`: Track name or ID (optional -- if omitted, enter Guided Selection)
- `--phase <N>`: Revert only phase N (optional)
- `--task <name>`: Revert only a specific task (optional)
- No scope flag: revert the entire track

---

## Step 1: Parse Target Scope

Determine what to revert:
- **Track-level**: No `--phase` or `--task` flag. Revert all commits in the track.
- **Phase-level**: `--phase N` specified. Revert commits from phase N only.
- **Task-level**: `--task <name>` specified. Revert a single task's commit.

If no `<track>` argument, proceed to Guided Selection.

## Step 1a: Guided Selection (when no track argument)

Read `.maestro/tracks.md` and recent maestro git history (`git log --oneline --since="7 days ago" --grep="maestro"`).

Present a menu grouped by track showing ID, description, status, and completed task count. If user provides a custom track ID, use that.

## Step 2: Locate Track

Match track argument against IDs and descriptions in `.maestro/tracks.md`. If not found: report and stop.

## Step 3: Resolve Commit SHAs

If `metadata.json` has `beads_epic_id`: use `br list --status closed --parent {epic_id} --all --json` and parse `close_reason` for SHAs (`sha:{7char}`), scoped by labels for `--phase`/`--task`. Otherwise: extract SHAs from plan.md.
See `reference/git-operations.md` for full SHA resolution protocol (steps 3a-3c).

## Step 4: Git Reconciliation

Verify each SHA exists, detect merge commits and cherry-pick duplicates.
See `reference/git-operations.md` for reconciliation protocol (steps 4a-4b).

## Step 5: Present Execution Plan

Show exactly what will be reverted with commit list, affected files, and plan updates.
See `reference/confirmation-and-plan.md` for the plan format.

## Step 6: Multi-Step Confirmation

Two-phase confirmation with optional plan revision loop.
See `reference/confirmation-and-plan.md` for the confirmation protocol.

## Step 7: Execute Reverts

Revert in reverse chronological order. Handle merge commits and conflicts.
See `reference/git-operations.md` for execution protocol (step 7).

## Steps 8-10: Update Plan State, Registry, and Verify

Reset plan markers, update registry status, run test suite.
See `reference/git-operations.md` for details (steps 8-10).

If `metadata.json` has `beads_epic_id`, also reopen BR issues: `br update {issue_id} --status open --json`.

## Step 11: Summary

Display revert summary with scope, commit counts, test results, and next steps.
See `reference/confirmation-and-plan.md` for the summary format.

## Relationship to Other Commands

Recommended workflow:

- `/setup` -- Scaffold project context (run first)
- `/new-track` -- Create a feature/bug track with spec and plan
- `/implement` -- Execute the implementation
- `/review` -- Verify implementation correctness
- `/status` -- Check progress across all tracks
- `/revert` -- **You are here.** Undo implementation if needed
- `/note` -- Capture decisions and context to persistent notepad

Revert is the safety valve for `/implement`. It undoes commits and resets plan state so you can re-implement with `/implement`. Use `/status` after reverting to confirm the track state is correct. Revert depends on atomic commits from implementation -- the cleaner the commit history, the more precise the revert.
