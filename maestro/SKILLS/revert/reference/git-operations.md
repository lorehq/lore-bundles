# Git Operations for Revert

## Step 3: Resolve Commit SHAs

### 3a: Extract Implementation SHAs

**BR-enhanced path**: If `metadata.json` has `beads_epic_id`:
- Use `br list --status closed --parent {epic_id} --all --json` to get all closed issues
- Parse the `close_reason` field for SHAs (format: `sha:{7char}`)
- Scope by labels: `--label "phase:{N}"` for phase-level, match task title for task-level
- Falls back to plan.md parsing if BR command fails or returns no results

**Legacy path**: Read `.maestro/tracks/{track_id}/plan.md`.

Extract `[x] {sha}` markers from the appropriate scope:
- **Track**: All `[x] {sha}` markers
- **Phase N**: Only markers under `## Phase N`
- **Task**: Only the marker for the matching task

### 3b: Identify Plan-Update Commits

Search for commits that marked tasks as done in this track's plan.md:

```bash
git log --oneline --all --grep="maestro(plan): mark task" -- .maestro/tracks/{track_id}/plan.md
```

Add any matching SHAs to the revert list alongside the implementation commits.

### 3c: Identify Track Creation Commit (track-level revert only)

If reverting the entire track:

```bash
git log --oneline --all --grep="chore(new-track): add track {track_id}"
```

If found, add this SHA to the revert list so the track entry itself is removed from tracks.md.

If no SHAs found in scope (no implementation SHAs from 3a, and no plan-update commits from 3b):
- Report: "No completed tasks found in the specified scope. Nothing to revert."
- Stop.

---

## Step 4: Git Reconciliation

For each SHA in the combined revert list, verify it exists:

```bash
git cat-file -t {sha}
```

CRITICAL: Validate this command succeeds for each SHA before continuing.

**If SHA exists**: Add to revert list.

**If SHA is missing** (rebased, squashed, or force-pushed):
- Warn: "Commit {sha} no longer exists (likely rewritten by rebase/squash)."
- Try to find the replacement:
  ```bash
  git log --all --oneline --grep="{original commit message}"
  ```
- If found: offer to use the replacement SHA
- If not found: skip this commit and warn user

### 4a: Merge Commit Detection

For each SHA that exists:

```bash
git cat-file -p {sha}
```

If two or more `parent` lines are present, it is a merge commit. Warn for each:

"Commit {sha} is a merge commit. Reverting merge commits may have unexpected results."

Ask the user: "One or more commits to revert are merge commits ({sha_list}). How should we proceed?"
Options:
- **Proceed anyway** -- Attempt git revert with -m 1 for merge commits
- **Skip merge commits** -- Exclude merge commits from the revert list
- **Cancel** -- Abort the revert

### 4b: Cherry-pick Duplicate Detection

Compare commit messages across all SHAs:

```bash
git log --format="%H %s" {sha1} {sha2} ...
```

For any two commits with identical subject lines, compare patches:

```bash
git diff {sha_a}^ {sha_a}
git diff {sha_b}^ {sha_b}
```

If patches are substantively identical, treat as duplicates. Remove the older duplicate:

"Deduplicated: {sha_older} is a cherry-pick of {sha_newer} -- keeping only {sha_newer} in the revert list."

---

## Step 7: Execute Reverts

Revert commits in **reverse chronological order** (newest first).

For standard commits:
```bash
git revert --no-edit {sha_newest}
git revert --no-edit {sha_next}
```

For merge commits (if user chose "Proceed anyway"):
```bash
git revert --no-edit -m 1 {merge_sha}
```

CRITICAL: Validate each `git revert` command succeeds before continuing.

**On conflict**:
1. Report: "Merge conflict during revert of {sha}."
2. Show conflicting files
3. Ask the user: "Merge conflict in {file}. How should we proceed?"
   Options:
   - **Help me resolve** -- Show me the conflict and I'll guide resolution
   - **Abort revert** -- Cancel remaining reverts (already-reverted commits stay)
   - **Accept theirs** -- Keep the current version (discard the revert for this file)

---

## Step 8: Update Plan State

Edit `plan.md`: For each reverted implementation task, change `[x] {sha}` back to `[ ]`.

**BR mirror**: If `metadata.json` has `beads_epic_id`, also reopen the corresponding BR issues:

```bash
br update {issue_id} --status open --json
```

Look up `{issue_id}` from `metadata.json` `beads_issue_map` for each reverted task.

```bash
git add .maestro/tracks/{track_id}/plan.md
git commit -m "maestro(revert): update plan state for reverted {scope}"
```

CRITICAL: Validate the commit succeeds.

## Step 9: Update Registry (if track-level revert)

If the entire track was reverted and the track creation commit was NOT in the revert list:
- Edit `.maestro/tracks.md`: Change track status from `[x]` or `[~]` to `[ ]`
- Update metadata.json: set `"status": "new"`

```bash
git add .maestro/tracks.md .maestro/tracks/{track_id}/metadata.json
git commit -m "maestro(revert): reset track {track_id} status"
```

If the track creation commit WAS reverted, the tracks.md entry was already removed -- skip this step.

## Step 10: Verify

```bash
CI=true {test_command}
```

CRITICAL: Validate this command completes. Report exit code and output summary.
- **Tests pass**: Report success.
- **Tests fail**: Warn user and offer to debug.
