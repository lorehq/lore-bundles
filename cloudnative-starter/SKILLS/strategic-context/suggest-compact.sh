# Strategic Context Suggester
# Runs on pre-action hooks to suggest context compaction at logical intervals

# Why manual over auto-compact:
# - Auto-compact happens at arbitrary points, often mid-task
# - Strategic compacting preserves context through logical phases
# - Compact after exploration, before execution
# - Compact after completing a milestone, before starting next

# Track tool call count (increment in a temp file)
